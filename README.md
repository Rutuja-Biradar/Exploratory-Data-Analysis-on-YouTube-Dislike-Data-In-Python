# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-YouTube-Dislike-Data-In-Python
Problem Statement: Explore and do data analysis on the YouTube dislike dataset using required libraries and drive meaningful insights by performing EDA
Initially i have checked the missing values percentage and i dropped them because the datatype of the column is object i.e., 'Comments' and performed statistical summary on whole dataset. Added new columns and replaced the values with suitable value based on given requirement and making the columns into required datatypes. Finding the title of the video which has the maximum number of likes and maximum number of dislikes as per requirement. Finally plotted scatter plot for the columns "view_count" and "dislikes".

Conclusion:
from the plot it is observed that the dislikes are more prominent, suggesting that hiding dislikes can be an advantage for end users and to increase positivity the channel owner would focus on making content and productivity-oriented videos in near future
